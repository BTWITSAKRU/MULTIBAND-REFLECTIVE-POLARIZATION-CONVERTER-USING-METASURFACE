##  Project Abstract 
Metasurfaces are composed of artificially engineered periodic resonant structures capable of altering the amplitude, frequency, phase, and polarization of incident electromagnetic (EM) waves. Problems including atmospheric mismatches, reflection effects, and polarization mismatches frequently affect communication links. When transmitting and receiving antennas have different polarizations, polarization mismatching occurs. This problem can be solved by circularly polarized antennas, but their design necessitates intricate feeding methods that aren't always feasible.

To prevent polarization mismatching, Metasurfaces can be combined with antennas and have the ability to change the polarization of electromagnetic waves. Polarization mismatches in communication lines can be successfully addressed by employing a metasurface as a superstrate to transform the linear polarization of an incident electromagnetic wave into circular polarization during the reflection phase. In our previous work, we designed a metasurface that achieved polarization conversion across four distinct frequency bands: three bands for linear-to-linear polarization conversion and one band for linear-to-circular polarization conversion. The performance was observed by plotting the corresponding graphs, demonstrating the metasurface's effectiveness in addressing polarization mismatches.

Building on this, we have now designed a metasurface operating as a polarization converter within the 4â€“8 GHz frequency range. The impact of the metasurface on key characteristics, including polarization conversion efficiency, has been thoroughly evaluated. Moving forward, we aim to fine-tune the metasurface design further and conduct a detailed analysis of its current distribution. Following this, we plan to fabricate the optimized design and carry out experimental measurements to validate its performance and compare the results with simulations, ensuring its practical application.

## E Project Objectives 
- Analyze the designed metasurface by calculating the axial ratio, current distributions, and determining ellipticity to evaluate polarization performance.
- Fabricate the metasurface to test its performance in real-world conditions.
- Compare the simulated results with experimental results.
